# **App Name**: Compounder's Luck

## Core Features:

- User Input Collection: Prompts the user for initial investment, payout percentage, number of stages, and simulated win rate.
- Trade Simulation: Simulates individual trades based on a win rate, returning 'WIN' or 'LOSS'.
- Strategy Execution: Executes the 'Progressive Compound' strategy: progresses through stages and steps, handles wins/losses at each step.
- Output and Logging: Provides structured feedback to the user in each stage. In particular, prints messages at the start, prints intermediate values and updates during the simulation, and congratulates the user (or tells them the simulation failed) at the end.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark green (#386641) to evoke feelings of finance, nature, growth, and prosperity.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated green (#242625).
- Accent color: A vivid golden yellow (#E6B800), to add a highlight that suggests success.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for headlines or body text
- Simple, clean icons for representing different simulation states and outcomes (win, loss, stage complete).
- A clear, linear layout to reflect the sequence of trades and the user-provided data.
